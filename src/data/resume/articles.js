      "This study introduces a novel approach for detecting Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) cells through a custom GAN-based segmentation model, achieving high accuracy rates for both healthy and blast cells. Utilizing HSV color space for precise color representation and synthetic image generation, the model outperforms established models like Attention U-Net, UÂ²Net, and SegNet. The integration of DC-GAN enhances dataset quality, positioning GAN as a promising tool for future applications in medical image analysis and classification.",
